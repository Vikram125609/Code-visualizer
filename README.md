# Code-visualizer
A Open Source Project

By Using Our Platform Student Will Get To Know Where There Code Break Or Goes Under Infinite Loop

So Basically What We Are Going To Do We Will Be Creating a Visualization Platform Which Will Help Student To Visualize The Code For Example Frog Jump Problem

So Right Now Our Goal Is To Work On These Types Of Algorithm 

Recursion, Dynamic Programming (Memoization + Tabulation), DFS
